For most of the examples in this chapter, please see the repository for
[Textproof](https://github.com/codemouse92/textproof). Checkout the branch
`example_starter` for the basic repository structure and packaging files,
but without the code and tests, so you can practice along with Chapter 20.
The `main` branch of that repository contains the complete source code and
tests.
