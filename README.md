*Dead Simple Python* introduces the entire Python language to existing developers who are impatient to write production code. Instead of rehashing elementary computer science topics, the book dives deep into idiomatic Python patterns and the reasoning behind them. Packed with nuanced coding examples, this comprehensive guided tour of Python touches every single facet of the core language. Looking in, Python's patterns may look unusual, but looking back, you will agree they really are Dead Simple!

## Using and Sharing This Code

The code contained herein is copyrighted, and made available for your study and
reference. It is NOT "open source." Attribution is required if you share, and
commercial use is prohibited. See LICENSE.md.

That said, I recognize that some examples herein are fairly rudimentary. Use
common sense and common courtesy. If you get the syntax or technique from me,
but incorporate it into your own original code, I don't expect attribution.
On the other hand, if you get the whole example from me, and just
change the variable names, it's probably not okay.
